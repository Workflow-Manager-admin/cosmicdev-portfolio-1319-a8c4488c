## Introduction

Kavia is a collaborative, multi-agent platform for software development, focusing on robust workflows and production-quality code. Whereas many tools generate code in a single step (the “one-shot” approach), Kavia replicates the end-to-end engineering lifecycle: planning, writing, testing, review, iteration, and deployment. Kavia’s unique agent team—specialized in planning, coding, testing, documentation, bug fixing, etc.—works together to verify the completeness and correctness of your software at each stage.

## Kavia vs. One-Shot Tools

**One-shot Tools:**
- Generate code from a single prompt.
- No awareness of overall project goals or file structure.
- Minimal testing and little to no validation.
- User must manually review, patch, test, and deploy.

**Kavia Platform:**
- Breaks down requirements and plans strategy.
- Autonomously divides work between domain-specialist agents (Planning, Coding, Testing, Documentation, Bug Fixing, etc.).
- Ensures thorough in-repo testing and visual and artifact-based validation.
- Supports multiple iterations based on test results, errors, and user feedback.
- Produces ready-to-run code, with documented, test-covered, and deployable output.

## End-to-End Workflow Overview

### 1. Project Creation

- **Start a New Project:** Initialize a fresh codebase or connect Kavia to your existing code repo.
- **Define Requirements:** Clearly describe the software you want to build, including its main features, technologies, and design goals. The more specific your requirements, the better Kavia can help.

#### Example
```
Build a space-themed developer portfolio website.
Stack: React.js, modern dark UI, animated hero section, skills and projects gallery, responsive design.
```

### 2. Requirement Breakdown & Planning

- **PlanningAgent** analyzes high-level requirements and breaks them into actionable subtasks.
- Kavia creates (or extends, in the case of an existing repo) a modular plan for code generation, test coverage, UI/UX, and documentation.

### 3. Agent Collaboration Workflow

Kavia employs multiple expert agents, each responsible for a specific part of the process:
- **PlanningAgent:** Task breakdown and architectural strategy.
- **CodeWritingAgent:** Implements new features and code based on the plan.
- **TestCodeWritingAgent:** Writes and updates unit and integration tests.
- **TestExecutionAgent:** Runs tests and reports failures.
- **BugFixingAndVerificationAgent:** Identifies, fixes, and verifies bugs.
- **VisualVerificationAgent:** Checks the look and feel of web app UI.
- **DocumentationAgent:** Produces and updates architecture docs, diagrams, and onboarding help.

Agents collaborate and iterate, using each other’s outputs to move the software towards completion.

### 4. Code Generation

- **CodeWritingAgent** creates new files, modifies existing source, and refactors as needed.
- Code is formatted, follows project structure, and best practices are enforced.

### 5. Testing & Verification

- **TestCodeWritingAgent** ensures both new and existing code paths are thoroughly tested.
- **TestExecutionAgent** runs all tests in CI mode.
- **BugFixingAndVerificationAgent** rapidly fixes discovered defects and triggers retesting.
- **VisualVerificationAgent** checks actual UI rendering for web projects.

### 6. Review & Iteration

- Kavia loops through planning, coding, testing, and bug fixing until all tests pass and visual/UI checks are complete.
- Only production-ready code proceeds to the next stage.

### 7. Final Validation & Deployment

- **DocumentationAgent** delivers linked architecture docs, onboarding instructions, and, if configured, deployment steps.
- The output codebase is ready for deployment or further manual extension as needed.

## Actionable Tips for Success

- **Be Specific:** The more detail you provide in project requirements, the better results you’ll get.
- **Iterate Promptly:** Use Kavia’s feedback (test failures, error logs, UI checks) to add clarifying instructions or patches.
- **Review Output:** Always inspect the generated code and documentation—though Kavia automates review, user confirmation is invaluable.
- **Use Logical Groupings:** Structure your features and requirements in terms of components, pages, or modules to help the agents plan effectively.
- **Version Control:** If extending an existing repo, make sure your codebase is in a clean state before starting.
- **Explore Agent Roles:** If a particular agent’s output seems lacking, consider refining the relevant requirements or direct Kavia to rerun that agent.

## Kavia Quick Start Cheat Sheet

**Common Actions & How to Trigger Them:**

- **Start a new app/project:**  
  `Create a new project for a space-themed portfolio website using React.js, featuring animated backgrounds and a projects section.`

- **Add a feature or page:**  
  `Add a “Contact Me” section with a styled form and email send functionality.`

- **Run app locally:**  
  In your project directory:
  ```
  PORT=3000 BROWSER=none npm start
  ```

- **Run tests:**  
  ```
  npm run test
  ```

- **Review docs:**  
  See `kavia-docs/` for architecture, onboarding, and workflow documents.

## Example Workflow

1. **Define Goal:**  
   “Build a React JS portfolio site with About, Projects, Skills, Contact sections, and cosmic 3D animation.”

2. **Kavia creates plan:**  
   Breaks goal into features, pages, components, test suites, and documentation items.

3. **Code Generation:**  
   Autonomously writes React components, project structure, styling, assets, etc.

4. **Automated Test Coverage:**  
   Generates and runs tests for components and features.

5. **Agent Iteration:**  
   Kavia agents fix failing tests, patch visuals, and improve documentation.

6. **Validation/Review:**  
   User reviews, requests further edits, or triggers deployment.
